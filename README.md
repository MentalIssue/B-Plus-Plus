## B-Plus-Plus/B++ (Programming Language)

> Release Date: Soon
>> <red> This Programming language is private, only examples and codes are open source. </red>

### Introduction
Now I'm really into it so I made a next version of B# and it's called B++ (B++'s compiler is written in B#, B, Python, and JavaScript).  
The B++ is quite similar to B# and B but ***it's more powerful***.

***B++ scripts have the file extension of .bpp, .bpx, .bxx, .b++, .hb, .hbp, .hbpp, .hbx, .hbxx, and .hb++.***  
***This programming language will support graphics.***
